Work I.T is a talent attraction/management platform built to take the stress and uncertainty out of the recruitment process for both candidates and employers. As an employer, you are able to post jobs to the platform and let our incredibly sophisticated and complex matching algorithm only show your active job to candidates that have that right skill set.
As a candidate you can shortlist yourself for that job and notify the client of your application. From there, go through a technical test with the client and if you're succesful, happy days! 

Finding talent, fast.

* Once vetted by the Work I.T team, Alex is able to post his 10 Data Engineer roles to the platform
* The platform instantly finds and notifies the perfect candidates for the role
* Once those candidates have shortlisted themselves, Alex is able to view them and get in contact with them for a quick chat and technical test
* Alex them offers the 10 Data Engineers and marks them as "placed" on the platform

Had an issue with Modals with seemed to be common with our cohort. Passing information from an API request down 2 or 3 levels of components proved to be pretty tricky, but we got it working in the end!
